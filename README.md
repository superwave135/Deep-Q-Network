# deep-q-network
Deep reinforcement learning combines artificial neural networks with a reinforcement learning architecture that enables software-defined agents to learn the best actions possible in virtual environment in order to attain their goals. In this practice, we're to train a neural network model that approximate the Q-value function and apply it to instruct an agent to play cartpole "game" (provided by GYM environment). After completing all the tasks, you'll: understand how reinforcement learning works using deep neural networks. implement the Deep Q-Network (DQN) on the game of Cartpole.
